#2.Logiacl operators such as and, or, not
#3.Comparision operators such as !=,==,<,>,<=,>=
#4.Assignment operators such as =,+=,-=,*=,/=,etc.


#let's start mini project: Calculator program (with Expressions)

# a=int(input("Enter the number: "))
# b=int(input("Enter the number: "))

# messages=["small","big"]

# print(messages[(a + b) < 100])
a = 10
a *= 2 + 3
print(a)
