'''
ðŸ”¹ What is Vectorization?
    Vectorization is the process of replacing slow, repetitive loops in Python with fast, 
    optimized operations that work on entire arrays at once (using NumPy).

import time

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Without vectorization (loop)
start = time.time()
result = []
for x in nums:
    result.append(x + 10)
end = time.time()

print("Result:", result)
print("Time taken:", end - start)


import numpy as np
import time

nums = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# With vectorization
start = time.time()
result = nums + 10
end = time.time()

print("Result:", result)
print("Time taken:", end - start)
