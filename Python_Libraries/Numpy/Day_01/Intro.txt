# Numpy (Numerical Python) :

1. What is Numpy?
    It is a powerful python library that helps us perform fast and efficient
    numerical computations using arrays.

    * It provides a special data structure called "ndarray" (n-dimensional array)
      which is like a grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns.


2. Where it is used?
    It is used in many fields where large-scale numerical data needs to be handled, such as :

    - Data Science : for handling large datasets
    - ML & AI : for matrix operations, vectorized calculations
    - Image Processing : images are represented as arrays of pixel values
    - Scientific Computing : solving math-heavy problems like simulations
    - Finance - time-series data, statistical calculations
    

3. Why it is used?
    - Speed : it performs calculations faster than normal python lists
    - Memory efficiency : uses less memory compared to python lists
    - Multi-dimensional Data Handling : supports multi-dimensional arrays (1D,2D,3D, etc) to store and manipulate data easily


4. For what it is used?
    - Storing data in arrays(structured grid of numbers)
    - Performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      dot product
    - Statistical computations(mean, median, standard deviation)
    - Matrix operations(important in machine learning algorithms)
    - Data reshaping, filtering, selecting elements
    - Generating random numbers for simulations
